# stock-prediction-cap-jt
A simple application of machine learning using a decision tree regression algorithm to predict stock market trends.

I made this as a part of my capstone project using Jupyter Notebooks and the scikit-learn library.
In most cases, I have generally got a coefficient of determination of greater than 0.9 suggesting a 
fairly strong goodness of fit!
